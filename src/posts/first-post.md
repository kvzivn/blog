When we reach our goals without any hassle, a positive feeling spreads through our bodies.

I like that feeling. And i’m sure you do, too.

Many times, this positive feeling arises when we accomplish our goal by using a well designed tool or service. The positive feeling will also arise when we feel that we are in control of the product we are using. We like simplicity, because it reduces the time between an action and its goal.

Creating a simple product is not easy. Simplicity is not just something visual. It’s not just about minimalism or the reduction of hassle. It’s about having a deep understanding of the user goals and thereafter designing with a clear connection to the essential functionality of the product.
